 <p> Bulls’ ‘Hi-Flyer’ Pawan Sehrawat, arguably the best raider of the tournament, 
    became the first player in the Pro Kabaddi League, Season 7, to surpass 100 raid points, albeit in a loss against Puneri Paltans. 
    Sehrawat is an impressive 17 raid points ahead of than next-best Pardeep Narwal, despite having played a game fewer. 
    He is also one of only two raiders in the league averaging over 10 raid points per game, along with Dabang Delhi K.C.’s Naveen Kumar. 
     Sehrawat’s 29-point performance against Bengal Warriors earlier this season was the third-highest individual score in the history of the tournament.</p>

            Naveen carried the same vein in Season 7, emerging as the league MVP in just his second campaign while taking his team to the final. 
            Blessed with explosive speed and cat-like reflexes, Naveen also scored 22 Super 10s in 23 appearances in Season 7. His ability to deploy his staple move - the 'Running Hand Touch' to score points has made him an offensive juggernaut.</p>
